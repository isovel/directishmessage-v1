this code is terrible and i'm quite ashamed to have written it :/


a quick explaination on how to run this
---
the environment variable `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` needs to be set to the client secret of your discord application

you will also need to generate an OAuth2 URL (at https://discord.com/developers/applications/YOUR-APPLICATION-ID/oauth2) 
for login and replace it in `landing.html`, `landing.js`, and `server.js`.
